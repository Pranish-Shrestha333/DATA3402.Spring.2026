    "When I first started working on Exercise 1, my main goal was just to figure out how to make a grid that could change size based on what the user wanted, because the professor emphasized that it has to work for any n. I used a nested list comprehension because it felt like a really clean way to get the job done in one line, but after looking at the three different options provided by the AI, I realized there are a few ways to think about it. The first option with the nested for loops actually made a lot of sense to me because it breaks everything down step by step, which is helpful since I'm still getting used to how Python handles lists inside of lists. The second option was the most like mine, but it used the multiplication sign, and I learned from the LLM(gemini) that you have to be really careful with that so you don't accidentally link all your rows together. Comparing these helped me see that while my way is short and works well, understanding the longer \"manual\" way is important too so I don't get confused when the board logic gets more complicated later on. I have pasted the other three codes that I got from the LLM below."

    "this ex was a hurdle because it was the first time I had to manage real time user input alongside matrix indexing. I initially struggled with a error. I kept getting an IndexError or the marks would appear in the wrong spot because I forgot that Python lists start at index 0 while users naturally start counting at 1. I used Gemini to help me debug this mapping issue, which led me to realize I needed to subtract 1 from the user's input to align it with the board's internal indices. Furthermore I had to restructure my logic to satisfy the specific requirement of returning a boolean value. I originally thought a simple print of the board after user input would be enough but after using the LLM to review I modified the function to return True or False so the game loop could eventually tell the player to re-try their turn if they picked an occupied or invalid square."

It was cool to learn that 'A' is actually just the number 65 in computer code so adding i let me loop through the alphabet automatically. While using a loop the formatting kept breaking and it was quite confusing too. Using .join(row) made it way easier because it handles the dividers between the spaces. Getting the --- dividers to match the width of the columns took some trial and error for me too."

I also had to be very careful with how I translated string inputs like A2 you know into list indices remembering to subtract 1 so the code didn't crash with an IndexError. This exercise taught me that writing the individual functions is only half the work.the real difficulty is managing the game state and ensuring that the win-check logic scans the rows, columns, and diagonals correctly after every single turn."

    "The biggest hurdle with Exercise 11 was realizing that my code wasn't as organized as I thought it was. I spent a while staring at a NameError before it finally clicked that the computer opponent couldn't access the win-checking logic because I had put inside a different function earlier on. To fix this, I pulled that logic out and made it a standalone function called winn so both the human and the computer could use it. I learned that for a larger project like this, it's better to keep core logic like the winn() function in its own cell at the top so it's always available."

    "I didn't know what exhaustive search is and how does it work so I took help of LLM(gemini). I got that it's an approach where the computer evaluates every possible valid moves on bard and determine best outcome.initially struggled with how to let the computer \"predict\" the outcome of a move without actually changing the real game board. Through my discussion with Gemini, I learned the concept of a \"deep copy.\" I realized that to perform an exhaustive search the computer needs to create a temporary \"phantom\" version of the board for every empty square From that idea I tackled the logic in two stages: first, I wrote a loop that exhausted all possibilities to see if the computer could win immediately. But after trying several times I won in a game. I thought it would not let me win eiter make a droaw or i lose. I asked the gemini again why it happened why did i lose and i now realized that I have not actually used the max depth parameter.. I looked how can i use it and I implemented it below."

    "I was really confused by that TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable at first because it seemed like my move function was just randomly breaking. After looking at the traceback, I realized that location was becoming None, which meant smart_search wasn't actually finding any empty spots to return a move. That’s when it clicked that I had defined my game_grid outside of the for loop. Since I wasn't resetting the board for each new round, it stayed full after the very first game, leaving no room for the computer to play in rounds 2 through 10. Once I moved the board initialization inside the loop so it fresh-starts every time, the error disappeared and the simulation finally ran all 10 games properly.I observe the performance slowdown on larger grids. the performance slowdown on larger grids.IT was suggested to me by the gemini."
